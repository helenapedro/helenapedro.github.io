        <p class="paragraph">
          Helena did the last 3 years of her university career while working as a 
          data scientist and research analyst at GeoAngol, an experience that was 
          exhausting and challenging in similar proportions. During her time working 
          in a company that offers solutions to the oil and gas industry, Helena had 
          seen firsthand how technologies, machine learning, and big data tools have 
          been transforming how corporate decisions are made.</br></br>In 2021 she was 
          approached by a recruiter who allowed her to unleash her skills in the 
          e-commerce industry.
          CasaCon Home Center gave her an incredible opportunity. Helena was able to dive 
          deeper into data science, machine learning and Statistics and refine her professional 
          skills as well.</br>The capable leadership at CasaCon quickly identified Helena's project 
          management and analytical skills and they gave her huge responsibilities. During Helena's 
          watch, they closed strategic deals with 6+ companies that are now contributing more than 
          15% of the portfolio revenue.

              The project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities and identifying 
              suspicious stock behavior within stock data for a hedge fund.</br></br>
              Data extraction was conducted utilizing the yfinance library, 
              resulting in a pandas dataframe.</br>
              </br>Historical stock prices were obtained using the history() method, 
              with the period parameter determining the data timeframe. Additionally, dividends were 
              analyzed to assess profit distribution to shareholders.</br>
