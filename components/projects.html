            the yfinance library, data extraction was conducted, resulting in a pandas dataframe.</br>
            Fraud, in this context, refers to deceitful or criminal actions intended to generate 
            financial gain.</br>Historical stock prices were obtained using the history() method, 
            with the period parameter determining the data timeframe.</br> Additionally, dividends were 
            analyzed to assess profit distribution to shareholders.</br>No evident signs of fraud were 
            identified in the stock data.</br> Stock prices fluctuate based on factors such as outstanding 
            shares, future profits, and market demand, with trading activity continuously reported via stock 
            tickers.

            revealed that rear-wheel drive convertibles and hardtops commanded the highest 
            prices, while 4WD hatchbacks had the lowest value.</br></br>Analysis indicated a positive 
            linear relationship between engine size and price.</br></br>Key variables for predicting 
            car prices included various continuous numerical factors such as length, width, engine 
            size, and horsepower, along with categorical variables like drive wheels.</br></br>Data

            The primary objective of this project was to investigate differences 
            in blood pressure and educational attainment based on age, aiming to 
            determine if aging directly influences blood pressure.</br></br>Various 
            analytical techniques, including frequency tables, numerical summaries, 
            individual summary statistics, and graphical summaries, were employed. 
            </br></br>Results revealed disparities in both blood pressure and educational 
            attainment across different age groups.</br></br>While aging appears to correlate 
            with increased blood pressure, educational attainment demonstrates a "birth 
            cohort effect."</br></br>Younger individuals exhibit higher educational attainment 
            due to changing trends over decades, with the prevalence of college education 
            rising over time. As these cohorts age, the relationship between age and educational 
            attainment in cross-sectional data evolves accordingly.</br></br>The project utilized data 
            from the NHANES cross-sectional survey, collected at a single point in time, highlighting 
            the dynamic interplay between age, blood pressure, and educational attainment.
