         <h3>SpaceX Falcon 9 Analysis</h3>
         <p>
            The project utilizes advanced data science techniques to predict the 
            likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage, a key factor in driving down 
            launch costs. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into optimal launch 
            locations, enhancing the overall strategic planning for potential entrants 
            into the rocket launch market.

         <h3>Detecting Fraud In Stock Data</h3>
         <p>
            The project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities and identifying 
            suspicious stock behavior within stock data for a hedge fund.</br> Utilizing 
            the yfinance library, data extraction was conducted, resulting in a pandas dataframe.</br>
            Fraud, in this context, refers to deceitful or criminal actions intended to generate 
            financial gain.</br>Historical stock prices were obtained using the history() method, 
            with the period parameter determining the data timeframe.</br> Additionally, dividends were 
            analyzed to assess profit distribution to shareholders.</br>No evident signs of fraud were 
            identified in the stock data.</br> Stock prices fluctuate based on factors such as outstanding 
            shares, future profits, and market demand, with trading activity continuously reported via stock 
            tickers.

         <h3>Car Price Data Analysis</h3>
         <p>
            The objective of this project was to analyze car price data to identify 
            key variables influencing car prices.</br></br>Questions addressed included 
            examining the relationship between drive systems and vehicle prices, and 
            whether engine size could predict car prices.</br></br>Descriptive statistics, 
            scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation analyses were employed.</br></br>Results 
            revealed that rear-wheel drive convertibles and hardtops commanded the highest 
            prices, while 4WD hatchbacks had the lowest value.</br></br>Analysis indicated a positive 
            linear relationship between engine size and price.</br></br>Key variables for predicting 
            car prices included various continuous numerical factors such as length, width, engine 
            size, and horsepower, along with categorical variables like drive wheels.</br></br>Data 
            preprocessing steps and analytical methods are outlined, with insights drawn from groupby 
            analysis, heatmaps, and correlation studies.

         <h3>
            National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
            Data Analysis 
         </h3>
         <p>
            The primary objective of this project was to investigate differences 
            in blood pressure and educational attainment based on age, aiming to 
            determine if aging directly influences blood pressure.</br></br>Various 
            analytical techniques, including frequency tables, numerical summaries, 
            individual summary statistics, and graphical summaries, were employed. 
            </br></br>Results revealed disparities in both blood pressure and educational 
            attainment across different age groups.</br></br>While aging appears to correlate 
            with increased blood pressure, educational attainment demonstrates a "birth 
            cohort effect."</br></br>Younger individuals exhibit higher educational attainment 
            due to changing trends over decades, with the prevalence of college education 
            rising over time. As these cohorts age, the relationship between age and educational 
            attainment in cross-sectional data evolves accordingly.</br></br>The project utilized data 
            from the NHANES cross-sectional survey, collected at a single point in time, highlighting 
            the dynamic interplay between age, blood pressure, and educational attainment.
